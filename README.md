## Introduction

Built as my project during my Web Development Immersive Course at General Assembly in London, Rebel Alliance - Last Stand is a single player shoot-em-up, in which players compete to get a high score. 

## How to Play

You must prevent the Imperial Bombers from getting past the Falcon and reaching the rebel base. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the player left and right. Use the up key to fire the lazer cannon and the space bar to fire the powerful blaster - but use this blaster sparingly as you have limited ammo. Watch out for bombs dropped buy the bombers. Take out the attacking ships to get the highest score.

## Technologies

Rebel Alliance - Last Stand is built with HTML5/CSS and Javascript, it uses the jQuery library.

## Resources

Any resources used were either created by hand or are free of right and duly credited.
